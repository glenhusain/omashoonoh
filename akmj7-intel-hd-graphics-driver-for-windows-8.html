                            <p>Like the title says I am randomly getting these display driver crashes while surfing the internet. This started happening after the last Windows 10 Pro update that installed a couple weeks ago. The exact error is "Display driver Intel HD Graphics Drivers for Windows 8(R) stopped responding and has successfully recovered." I've tried going into device manager and uninstalling the driver through there, rebooting, searching for updates which pulls up the display driver, installing Do I download the Intel HD Graphics driver for Windows 10: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25188/Intel-HD-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10-64bit-3rd-Gen-BYT-. after my computer upgrading to win 10, I happened to be getting plenty of this messages popping up lately, and sometimes it makes my computer even crash HARD. my computer is a Acer Aspire V3-772G-747A321 Please 
Just bought and build new htpc machine. Everytime I tried to watch a video either using vlc or windows media player, this error message pop out: "display driver intel hd graphic drivers for windows 8® stopped responding and has successfully recovered", and the screen would blink and not respond. After blinking for several times, the whole system freeze. Here's the system setups: Mobo: asrock z97e-itx/ac cpu: intel i3-4360 gpu: intel hd graphics 4600 OS: win 7 64bit Bios: P1.30 I am trying to play star wars battlefront on a toshiba satelite that has intel core i3-2350M and i can't seem to figure out how to update the driver to version xx.xx.14.4264 First of all my internet driver i need is PCI/VEN_168C&DEV_0036&SUBSYS_064211AD&REV_01 and my graphics card thing is PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_0F31&SUBSYS_9051025&REV_0E. I tried the tips in the previous thread but it seems to be pretty outdated. The furthest I got where to here: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/search?keyword=hd+graphics when I download and point my driver update to the inf file, it then lists a bunch of drivers, 530, 5500, etc, but no 4400. Am I getting the wrong one? Which driver version works for my 4400 4th gen driver. Hey, I need some advice. I have been getting WHEA\_UNCORRECTIBLE\_ERROR intermittently since last august. I gave my laptop to dell service center, they performed a clean install and told me the issue is fixed. I have run all the dell diagnostics tests with no errors. I have also run memtest which gave me no errors. The laptop crashes randomly for no reason. It creates a dump file but stops at 100% progress on BSOD after which I have to force shut down using the power key. After analysing How many I do not try, I can not install the driver ( intel hd graphics Driver for windows server 2016 ). Who faced? Spec: Windiws server 2016 datacenter Intel i9 9900k Gigabyte Z390 AORUS ELITE-CF All drivers got up well! The problem is only with graphics and lan. BUT problem with LAN driver, I solved it like this https://www.ivobeerens.nl/2013/06/24/enable-the-intel-i217-v-nic-in-windows-server-2012/ (https://www.ivobeerens.nl/2013/06/24/enable-the-intel-i217. (Series 8 being Bean Canyon of course, both i3 and i5 impacted) 2 different machines now, it's had trouble installing the Intel IRIS graphics driver, I think (or realtek on one too) - it pulls down the driver, it is the correct driver (as far as I know) it can't install it. Not validated for this computer or something - I have to manually install it Anyone else see this? Literally manually downloading this file right now: https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28437 Release Not really sure what's going on but computer randomly during normal usage, not gaming BSOD. Upon reboot noticed it did the same overnight. Also have several notifications, that state "Application has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware. Application MsMpEng.exe has been blocked from access Graphics hardware". I tried a number of things including using DDU (in safe mode) to perform a clean uninstall of the nVidia drivers. From there though, the nvidia drivers would not install 
I have a couple of issues. Here is my setup: · Intel NUC8I7BEH NUC · Amazon Basics CL3 Rated HDMI Cable · Samsung UN65NU8000 · Windows 10 Pro first issue is screen blinking off and on randomly Intel Iris graphic control panel settings are 3840x2160 @ 60pHz Second issue is When I try to watch Netflix with the Microsoft edge browser the tv goes into a menu screen and says “We are adjusting the picture quality for you to experience a better uhd screen. You can change the setting in settin. HI!I have crash at start, i have dowloaded new nvidia drivers, and rebooted pc, but it is still dont work( Unity Player version: Unity 5.6.5f1_2cac56bf7bb6 nvd3dum.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005) in module nvd3dum.dll at 0023:5331efc8.

System is currently using Microsoft's display drivers made in 2006. I need a display driver so I can get the audio working through hdmi - I'm not sure if the Windows 10 had working HDMI audio because i didn't have it hooked up to a TV or Monitor with speakers 
Hi everyone, So I have a Intel Pentium B980 (2.40 GHz) on Windows 8.1 64bits. I tend to have graphic glitches of certain gifs with Firefox and a message saying that the "Display Driver has stopped responding and has recovered". So first reflex is to try to update the Driver but here is the catch, on the Intel site (https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/69669/Intel-Pentium-Processor-B980-2M-Cache-2-40-GHz-) I can choose between : - Intel® HD Graphics Driver for Windows 7/8/8.1-32bit. SOLVED - see comment While setting up my new X230 (IPS panel) I ran several live linux tools from a bootable flash drive and noticed that most of them had better control over the display brightness than the windows 10 that is now my main OS. The same goes for the BIOS setup menu, bootloader menus, memtest86+ and so on. My guess is that these systems just let the BIOS control the backlight and it does a fine job of it. Windows 10 gives me 16 discrete brightness stages Laptop's an HP Pavilion 15-au018wm (https://www.cnet.com/products/hp-pavilion-15-au018wm-15-6-core-i7-6500u-12-gb-ram-1-tb-hdd-us/specs/). Bought Monday under a 15-day return policy. TL;DR on its stats: Intel i7 6500U 12 gb DDR4 RAM NVIDIA GeForce 940MX - 2 GB DDR3 SDRAM 1TB HDD (Yeah, I know.) Windows 10 Home I've scanned the hard drive and memory. Perfectly fine. So, first I did I full reset of windows - I left my files, but I don't know if that makes a difference I've got a packard bell easy note TS13 and it's 3 years old. It doesn't heat up at all when I've got 5 other applications open, but the moment I load up the NXT client it slowly heats up and it doesn't stop, it just keeps getting hotter. Would I need to change the fan in my laptop, or is there some tweeks I can do to the NXT client to make it less of a strain on my laptop. I'm currently running the game on minimal graphics but with medium draw distance. Also I've downloaded the latest graphics. 
Just got the laptop. Everything looks good except random screen freeze/crashes with loading cursor (Most time browsing with MS Edge). The error message is like Display Driver Intel HD graphics drivers for Windows (8) stopped responding and was successfully recovered. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced the same issue? I got confused cause the error message said windows 8 but I have windows 10 64bit installed. 1 Display Driver intel HD Graphics Drivers for Windows 8(r) stopped responding and has Successfully Recovered.This one only pops up when I launch a game and I am using windows 7 not 8 2 NVDIA share is not responding.It froze my pc and I had to restart 3 The nvidia geforce device is not removable and cannot be ejected or unplugged.This popped up when I opened support assist.It also froze my pc and was making a weird noise and I had to restart. What is going When i play rust my display driver crashes after ca 10 minutes. It just says that my display driver stopped responding and that IT has Been restored. My display driver is Intel HD Graphics Drivers for Windows 8(R) I am using a laptop, and i dont know much about PC Please. 1 Display Driver intel HD Graphics Drivers for Windows 8(r) stopped responding and has Successfully Recovered.This one only pops up when I launch a game and I am using windows 7 not 8 2 NVDIA share is not responding.It froze my pc and I had to restart 3 The nvidia geforce device is not removable and cannot be ejected or unplugged.This popped up when I opened support assist.It also froze my pc and was making a weird noise and I had to restart.
